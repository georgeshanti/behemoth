From myriad emotions to familiar scents, places and it's people to memories and journeys, a moment is never enough. Photography is the art of weaving a million stories from a single moment. It's never just about what is seen, it's always about how it is seen and experienced. For those who believe that immortality is just a click away, Excel 2017 brings you 'The Third Eye Photography Contest' in the memory of Vineeth Marar.
